# wadelab-amblyopia_code
Code used for generating and displaying 3D motion stimuli in the amblyopia/strabismus study of 2017


The "Batch_run_*" files run a full series of testing runs for a single subject (can be exited and resumed at any time)
whereas MID_Cue_thresholds_2IFC_M16_ambl.m and MID_Full_Cue_thresholds_2IFC_M16_ambl.m run only an individual threshold estimate run
for either CD/IOVD OR the FULL cue, respectively. 
(the Batch_run files call this function).
